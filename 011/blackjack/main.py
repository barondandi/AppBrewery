############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

#Variables
import random
cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
continue_playing = True
continue_current_game = True
continue_dealing = True

def deal_card():
    """Returns a random card from the deck"""
    # With the previous line I see the description of the function when I use it
    return random.choice(cards)
#print(deal_card())

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
#user_cards = []
#computer_cards = []

user_cards = []
computer_cards = []

for i in range(2):
    user_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())

#print(f"User cards: {user_cards}. Computer cards: {computer_cards}")

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
#and returns the score.
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

def calculate_score(input_cards):
    # Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
    if len(input_cards) == 2 and sum(input_cards) == 21:
        return 0 #A Blackjack is returned as a 0
    # Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
    elif sum(input_cards) > 21:
        for i in range(len(input_cards)):
            if input_cards[i] == 11: #Checking if I have got an Ace. DEBUG: Does it for all the Aces in the hand (shorted out in the second if)
                input_cards[i] = 1
                if sum(input_cards) == 21:
                    return sum(input_cards)
        return sum(input_cards)
    else:
        return sum(input_cards)

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.
user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
print(f"Your cards: {user_cards}, current score: {user_score}")
print(f"Computer cards: {computer_cards}, computer score: {computer_score}")
print(f"Computer's first card: {computer_cards[0]}")

if computer_score == 0:
    print("Computer blackjack. You lose ðŸ˜¤")
    continue_current_game = False
elif user_score > 21:
    print("You went over. You lose ðŸ˜¤")
    continue_current_game = False
elif user_score == 0:
    print("User blackjack. You win ðŸ˜ƒ")
    continue_current_game = False

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.
#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.
while continue_current_game and continue_dealing:
    another_card = input("Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: ")
    if another_card == "y":
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
        user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
        print(f"Your cards: {user_cards}, current score: {user_score}")
        print(f"Computer's first card: {computer_cards[0]}")
        if user_score > 21:
            print("You went over. You lose ðŸ˜¤")
            continue_current_game = False
    else:
        continue_dealing = False

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
