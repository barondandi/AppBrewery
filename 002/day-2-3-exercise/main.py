# HINT: There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
days_per_year = 365
weeks_per_year = 52

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT: "You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left."
estimated_lifespan = 90
years_left = estimated_lifespan - int(age)
months_left = years_left * months_per_year

years = 90 - int(age)
months = round(years * 12)

days = round(years * 365)
