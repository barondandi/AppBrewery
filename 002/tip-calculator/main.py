#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#If you want the final_amount to always have 2 decimal places.
#e.g. $12 becomes $12.00
#You can use this link to figure out how to do this:

#This is how you can implement it:
